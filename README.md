## Project Description

In this third project of the *Data Analytics Bootcamp*, we will work in a real Business case where we will be asked to create a *song recommendator* based in the user's song preferences, updating the current recommendator of the Company *Gnod*, based on preferences by artist. 

Moreover, we will be asked to show the proposition to the company CEO in a *recorded presentation*.

To achieve this, we will navigate into the *web scraping techniques* and the use of the *Spotify API*, in order to get a huge song database we will use afterwards.

Finally, we will use some basic techniques of *Machine Learning* as *clustering* to provide accurate recommendations based on the user's song.


## Workflow

First of all, we will do some web scraping to get the 100 songs from the famous *Top 100 Chart of Billboard*. 

Then the user will be asked to input a song they want to have more recommendations related and if this song is among the Top100, the user will receive another recommendation from the same ranking.

The interesting thing is if this user's song is not in the Top100 Chart because then, the app will give the user a recommendation from a huge *Spotify* database we created previously, and this recommendation will be based on the audio features of the user's song.

This will be possible thanks to *Machine Learning* techniques such as *clustering* the songs of the database in different clusters according to its features.


## Organization

First of all, I’ve planned my work with a *Kanban board* using the platform named *Trello*. There, you can plan every task of the project beforehand and set some deadlines for each one.

I’ve also created this *GitHub repository*, including an updated Readme.md file and a .gitigonore file, well structured and functional.
